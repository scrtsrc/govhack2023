Our app allows individuals to see what accessibility facilities there are available at local events and surrounds so they can enjoy the event they want to attend without worrying about the logistics of how to navigate the space! We hope it will one day turn into an open source database where individuals can contribute towards the information as there does not see to be a lot around (or easily accessible)!

Data collected from Perth is OK - used a scraper and their ROBOT.TXT file seems to say it was okay
Tried to collect data from https://visitperth.com/getting-around/accessibility (not very succesfully)

NOTE: For the deployed app, I've not supplied an Google Maps API key just incase it gets spammed

Next steps
- Want people to be able to add their own markers and say whether a place has accessiblity facilities(and the quality) because data appears to be lacking
